I like building things from scratch to understand how they work. Mostly neural networks and ML stuff lately, but I'll automate anything that annoys me enough.

### Projects

**Tachyon 2**: MoE transformer I built for pretraining. 8 experts per layer, only 2 active per token. Gets ~95k tok/s on an H100. The whole point was making something fast that I could actually train myself.

**Lepton**: Experimental LLM architecture. Has some ideas I wanted to try out - thought tokens, memory that persists across context, dynamic compute routing. Still a work in progress.
